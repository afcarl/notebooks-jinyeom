    "In this notebook, we're going to investigate a novel Neuroevolution method that evolves a population of Bayesian neural networks, which are defined by distributions of connection weights rather than fixed weights as in conventional neural networks. This way, we can hypothesize that mutation and crossover have softer changes to the network each generations, while also providing more exploration."
